# React + Vite Personal Project

This project is an idea that came to my mind since I can't find free apps that has the features that I need to master my guitar.
I decided to create this project with an idea in mind to create my own website that will assist me in mastering my guitar skills.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
