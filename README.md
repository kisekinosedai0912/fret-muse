# FretMuse (React + Vite)

This is a personal React + Vite project inspired by a simple problem: I couldn’t find a free guitar app that had all the features I needed to properly practice and improve my skills.

Instead of compromising, I decided to build my own.

The goal of this project is to create a web-based guitar practice assistant that helps me (and eventually others) develop better technique, consistency, and musical understanding through practical tools and exercises.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

This project is built using:

React – for building a dynamic and responsive user interface

Vite – for fast development, instant HMR, and optimized builds

Tailwind - for faster styling and mobile first concept development

## 🎯 Project Goals

Create a free and customizable guitar practice tool that focuses on features that actually help with daily practice

and to use this project as a way to improve both guitar skills and frontend development skills and assist beginner

guitarists in their journey into mastering their fretboard.
